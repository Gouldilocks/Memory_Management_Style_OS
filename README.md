 # Running the Program
 * I implemented both what the book says, and something I think is easier to test.
 * To run the easy test, run:

 ```
 javac Driver.java
 java Driver
 ```

 * If you want to run it the way the book wants to, then run this, substituting arg for the size of the memory you want:
 ```
 javac Allocator.java
 java Allocator <arg>
 ```
